Desktop application for finding study companion for online lectures.

## Idea

Application should have ability to connect with other learning platforms and link user's courses and lectures.
While watching a video, backend part is looking for other users who are watching the same video and assigning study companion among them with most common interests (based on courses enrolled).
Users then can interact with each other during lecture, and it should be possible to go back to previous chats later on and continue conversation.

## How it works

Deskop application is written in Java, and the backend part in NodeJS.
